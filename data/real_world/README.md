# Real World Instances


The file names describe what the containing data is based on. The last number in the file name is the number of points of that instance. In case of the files beginning with *deutsche_staedte* or *deutschland_bahnhoefe* the two succeeding numbers are the length and height of all boxes of the instance, since no edge lengths were naturally given.
